            <p>
              I am driven by a passion for problem solving. Whatever the
              project, the framework, or the goal, it is undoubtedly the
              challenge that drives me. Some people call it an obsession,
              they’re probably right. I understand the importance of the balance
              between form and function, and I know a good team can
              exponentially increase everyone’s potential. As a MERN stack web
              developer I look forward to the many challenges to come and the
              creative process of figuring out how to solve each one.
